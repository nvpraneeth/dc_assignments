# Input Parameters File
# Format: n k alpha beta
# Where:
#   n      - Number of processes (must be perfect square for Maekawa: 4, 9, 16, 25, etc.)
#   k      - Number of CS entries per process
#   alpha  - Average time for local computation (exponential distribution, in seconds)
#   beta   - Average time inside critical section (exponential distribution, in seconds)
#   Note: alpha < beta as per problem statement

# Default configuration (for quick testing)
9 15 2.0 5.0

# Experiment configurations (as per assignment requirements):
# For Experiment 1 & 2: Message and Time Complexity Analysis
# 
# Configuration 1: n=9 (3x3 grid for Maekawa)
# 9 15 2.0 5.0
#
# Configuration 2: n=16 (4x4 grid for Maekawa)
# 16 15 2.0 5.0
#
# Configuration 3: n=25 (5x5 grid for Maekawa)
# 25 15 2.0 5.0
#
# To run experiments, update the active line above with desired configuration
# and run the algorithms. For full experiments, use run-experiments.sh script
# which automatically tests all three configurations (n=9, 16, 25) with k=15.
